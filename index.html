            <p>First, though, we’ll take a look at the web development industry as it stands in 2022, and consider
                whether web development is a smart career move—with a particular focus on the impact of the Covid-19
                pandemic.</p>

            <p>I see myself progressing in my field as well as in my education. I find my education challenging and

                the skills and knowledge of my field towards professional advancement.</p>

            <h1>Goal</h1>
            <p>My main goal in life is to own a successful company. This is my main goal in life because I want to be
                able to be the boss, not have one. I want to be able to do what I want not what someone else wants. My
                short term goals this year were to pass every quarter with B+ and up.</p>

            <p>There are some things in life that are out of your control that you can't change and you've got to live
                with. The choice that we have, though, is either to give up or keep on going. I tell your life is
                interesting, Life is a JOURNEY. But I tell you there are sometimes in life where you fall down and you
                feel you don't have the strength to get back up. You see, if you try 100 times to get back up and if you
                fail 100 times, if you FAIL and you'll going to GIVE UP, do you think that you'll ever going to get up?
                No. But if you fail and try again? And again and again? For as long as you try there is always that
                chance of YOU getting up. Does that make sense? And it's not the end until you've given up. And just the
                fact that…show more content…
                Life is not always good. Life is not always rosy. Life is worth living when you find purpose. Everything
                you do, just follow your heart.</p>

            <h1>Know Our <br> Global Community</h1>

            <p>Just as people within a community depend on each other, countries of the world also depend on each other
                to fulfil their needs.


                Like people in a community, they also need to exchange goods, services, information and money. Thus,
                they are interdependent.

                Interdependence has many advantages. For instance, it allows the benefits of advances in science and
                technology to reach different parts of the world within a short period.</p>
